                <h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
                <p> I’m currently working at Cisco as an Activation Specialist, where I get to be part of a dynamic and innovative team. Alongside that, I'm also an English teacher, which allows me to share my love for language and communication with others—a role I find incredibly fulfilling.

                    Outside of work, I’m very much a family person. I share my home with two energetic dogs who happily take up most of my free time (and I wouldn't have it any other way). Whether it's long walks, playtime, or just dealing with their lovable chaos, they definitely keep life interesting.
                    
                    I'm someone who's always looking to learn something new—whether it’s professional development, picking up a new hobby, or just satisfying curiosity. Growth and learning are key parts of who I am.</p>

                <H2>WHAT I LIKE</H2>
                <p>I also have a passion for photography and traveling, not just locally but internationally—always with my girlfriend and our dogs by my side, chasing new landscapes and unique experiences. I enjoy the freedom of the road and love driving all types of vehicles, whether it's for a long trip or just the joy of movement. More than anything, I value being a good friend and make it a priority to care for the people in my life.</p>

                <H2>MUSIC</H2>
                <p>Even though I wouldn’t call myself a music expert, I genuinely love discovering new sounds—especially through recommendations from family and friends. Music has a special way of connecting people, and I’ve found some of my favorite moments come from those shared experiences. Whenever I get the chance to grab a ticket to a rave or music festival, I’m all in. There’s just something unforgettable about being surrounded by good vibes, living the moment—happy or sad—with music, family, and friends. Those are the memories that really stick with you.</p>
